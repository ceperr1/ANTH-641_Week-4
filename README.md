Week 4:

In the Petra Excavation Trenches Data project that I uploaded to OpenRefine, I made a few changes under "Context (4)" after initally merging the Special Project clustered values.
The first thing I noticed was there is a Trench 1 and a Trench 01. It would seem these two should be the same. I merged them and re-clustered.
After, I found Trench 102-103 and Trench 102-3. They were also merged after I changed Trench 102-3 to Trench 102-103?. 

Moving to the "Label" column, there were many values with an extra space between "Locus" and the number. I removed all the extra spaces because that cannot signal anything else.
However, many of the values also had "?" or "/" or various other signs. I left those alone because these signs could mean something different to the data recorder.
