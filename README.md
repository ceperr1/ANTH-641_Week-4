Week 4:

In the Petra Excavation Trenches Data project that I uploaded to OpenRefine, I made a few changes under "Context (4)" after initally merging the Special Project clustered values.
The first thing I noticed was there is a Trench 1 and a Trench 01. It would seem these two should be the same. I merged them and re-clustered.
After, I found Trench 102-103 and Trench 102-3. They were also merged after I changed Trench 102-3 to Trench 102-103. 

Moving to the "Label" column, there were many values with an extra space between "Locus" and the number. I removed all the extra spaces because that cannot signal anything else.
However, many of the values also had "?" or "/" or various other signs. I left those alone because these signs could mean something different to the data recorder. 

After, I moved to the Petra Animal Bones project and began editing the column "Common Name." I noticed there were a lot of repeats of animal and other names except one would be capitalized while another was lowercase, including Fox/fox, Chicken/chicken, Dog/dog, Sheep/Goat - sheep/goat, Shell/shell, Pig/pig, CAMEL/camel, and GOAT/goat. I changed them all to the capital form and merged the data.

In the "Element" column, there was a similar issue. A few of the values had both capitalized and lowercased versions again. These include SCAPULA/scapula, RIB/rib, and PELVIS/pelvis. I once again changed these words to match each other. For example, SCAPULA/scapula -> Scapula. I did this with each.
